# Verify

Verify a site package across runtime, spec, and documentation before install.

## When to Load

- After building the package and writing DOC.md (guide.md Step 8)
- Standalone re-verification of an existing site package
- After any site update (new operations, auth fix, transport change)

**Independent verifier:** Verification should be performed by a separate agent
from the one that curated the spec. This separation catches blind spots.

## Example File Format

Example fixtures at `examples/*.example.json` are used by verify and runtime exec:

```json
{
  "operation_id": "searchProducts",
  "order": 1,
  "cases": [{
    "input": { "k": "laptop" },
    "assertions": { "status": 200, "response_schema_valid": true }
  }]
}
```

Optional fields:
- **`order`** — execution order for verify (lower = earlier). Use when operations have dependencies (e.g., addToCart before removeFromCart). Files without `order` run after ordered files, sorted alphabetically.
- **`replay_safety`** — `"safe_read"` (default) or `"unsafe_mutation"`. `unsafe_mutation` ops are skipped by default and only run when verify is invoked with `--write`.

Files without a `cases` array are treated as malformed example files and fail verify. For adapter-only
packages where compile doesn't generate examples, create them manually.

## Three Dimensions

All three must pass before install.

```
Verify
├── Runtime  — does the operation execute and return data?
├── Spec     — does the spec follow curation standards?
└── Doc      — does DOC.md match the spec and follow template?
```

---

## Runtime Verify

### Batch Verify

```bash
openweb verify <site>
openweb verify <site> --browser              # pre-start/keep alive the managed browser
openweb verify <site> --ops op1,op2          # only verify specific operations
openweb verify <site> --ops op1 --browser    # combine filters
```

Browser-backed ops already auto-start Chrome on demand. Use `--browser` when you
want the managed browser up front and kept alive across the verify run (useful
for auth cascades, CAPTCHA/manual-login prep, or avoiding browser idle shutdown).
Use `--ops` to debug individual operations without running the full suite.
The `--ops` value is a comma-separated list of operation IDs with **no spaces**
(e.g., `--ops searchStores,getMenu`, not `--ops searchStores, getMenu`).

#### Status Interpretation

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `PASS` | Works | Continue to runtime exec |
| `DRIFT` | Works but type change or required field missing detected | Advisory warning (exit 0). Review schema if persistent |
| `auth_expired` | Session expired | `openweb login <site>`, `openweb browser restart`, rerun |
| `FAIL` | Execution failed | Read detail line, fix spec or environment, rerun |
| `FAIL` (403 + cookies) | CSRF misconfiguration | Check `authCandidates[0].csrfOptions` in analysis.json |

Single-site verify exits non-zero for `FAIL`, `auth_expired`, or `bot_blocked`. `DRIFT` is advisory and still exits 0.

### Runtime Exec

Batch verify checks HTTP sanity. Runtime exec proves an agent can get usable
data against the target intents identified during discovery.

Read the site's DOC.md to find target intents, then exec the best operation for
each:

```bash
openweb <site> exec <operation> '{"param": "value"}'
```

**Exit criterion:** Each target intent has at least one operation returning
real data — HTTP 2xx, valid JSON, non-empty response with expected fields.

If all pass → continue to Spec Verify.
If any fail → diagnose below.

### Diagnosis Table

| Response | Likely Cause | Fix |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| 403 | Wrong CSRF config, missing headers, expired session | Check CSRF cookie/header names. Check if CSRF scope excludes GET. If cookies missing: `openweb login <site>` |
| 401 | Session expired | `openweb login <site>`, restart browser |
| 999 / bot block | Node transport hitting bot detection | Switch to `transport: page` |
| 200 HTML (not JSON) | SSR page endpoint, not API | Remove op and use API equivalent, or add extraction config |
| 404 | Wrong path template | Fix path parameter normalization in spec |
| 400 | Bad param examples or missing required params | Update `exampleValue` fields |
| 200 empty/wrong data | Wrong query variables or response schema | Compare captured request params vs what you're sending |
| Timeout / hang | Stale token cache, browser not running | `openweb browser restart`, clear token cache |
| 429 | Rate limited by site | Verify uses 1.5s inter-op delay; if still hitting limits, add `headers` with custom UA or reduce batch size |
| Redirect loop | Auth-gated endpoint, not logged in | Log in, or remove endpoint |

After fixing the spec, return to batch verify.

### Failure-Based Loop Targets

| Failure | Return to |
|---|---|
| 403 / 999 / bot block / redirect loop / wrong signing | Probe (Step 2) — re-discover transport |
| Missing operation / missing evidence / missing write-time token | Capture (Step 4) — gather more evidence |
| Schema, naming, doc, or merge-quality issue | Build Package (Step 7) — fix spec/doc |
| Auth expired | Login and rerun verify |
| 2 cycles with no progress on same failure | Stop — document in DOC.md Known Issues |
| Bot detection blocks all transports | Stop — document blocker, inform user |
| Only non-target bonus ops fail | Proceed to Install — document in Known Issues |

> **Node transport trust:** `node_candidate` from probe is provisional.
> Node transport is only trusted after verify passes under runtime conditions.
> If node-transport operations fail with 403/999/bot-block, switch to
> `transport: page` and re-verify.

### WS Verification

If AsyncAPI operations are present, verify:

| Check | What to verify |
|-------|---------------|
| **Connection** | WebSocket connects with the detected auth |
| **Heartbeat** | Interval matches spec config |
| **Subscribe** | Subscribe operations receive expected event types |
| **Message shape** | Incoming messages are intelligible and match the expected envelope well enough for the site workflow. Current runtime verify does **not** perform WS schema diff yet |

WS failures usually stem from auth or URL issues. Check the connection URL
template and auth header injection before re-capturing.

---

## Spec Verify

Review the curated spec fresh — the verifier should not have seen curation
decisions.

Curation standards are defined in `curate-operations.md`, `curate-runtime.md`,
and `curate-schemas.md`. This checklist verifies compliance without restating
those standards.

### Checklist

| Check | Pass criterion |
|-------|---------------|
| **No noise** | No analytics, tracking, CDN, telemetry, or heartbeat-only operations |
| **No anti-bot params** | No `dm_*`, `w_rid`, `x-bogus`, `__a/__d/__s`, `msToken` in param lists |
| **Naming** | camelCase verb+noun (`searchProducts`, not `getApiV1Search`) |
| **Summaries** | Each operation has a summary listing 3-5 key response fields |
| **Auth** | `x-openweb.auth` matches site's actual pattern; CSRF present if needed |
| **Transport** | Correct per bot-detection level; browser-backed ops have the needed `page_plan`, and extraction ops have `page_url` when required |
| **Permissions** | GET → read, mutations → write/delete, GraphQL queries via POST → read |
| **Schemas** | No bare `type: object` for ops returning structured JSON |
| **No PII** | No real user data in parameter examples or fixtures |
| **Write ops** | Permission set, safety level documented, `replay_safety = unsafe_mutation` |
| **replay_safety** | `replay_safety` in `x-openweb` → spec MUST NOT contain; field belongs in `examples/*.example.json` only. Use `safety` (`safe`/`caution`) in the spec's `x-openweb` block |
| **Extraction** | Complex expressions (>5 lines) extracted to adapter files |

### Merge Integrity (existing packages only)

If curation merged with an existing package:

- Existing write operations preserved
- Existing adapter references preserved
- Existing auth config preserved (unless explicitly replaced)
- No duplicate operations (same path + method)

### Write/Undo Pair Asymmetry — Silent-Success Canary

For sites where writes return opaque-200 envelopes (YouTube InnerTube, many GraphQL mutations, IG mobile-API), HTTP status alone can't distinguish "succeeded" from "silently no-op'd". The reliable signal is **pairing the write with its inverse**:

- A `do` op (`subscribeChannel`, `followUser`, `savePin`) running unauthenticated may HTTP-200 with empty body — looks fine in isolation.
- The paired `undo` op (`unsubscribeChannel`, `unfollowUser`, `unsavePin`) correctly 401s, because there's no state to undo.
- The asymmetry — do passes, undo fails — is the **only** evidence the do-side never wrote anything.

**Action when verifying write ops:**
1. Always include both directions of a pair in `--ops` lists.
2. If one side passes and the other fails, suspect missing auth on the passing side, not a fixture problem on the failing side.
3. For an op without a natural inverse (`createPost`, `sendMessage`), follow the do-op with a confirming read (`getPost`, `listMessages`) and assert the new id appears.

This pattern surfaced YouTube's missing `sapisidhash` binding on `subscribeChannel` in the 2026-04-18 sweep (`8cfebff`). The `do` side had been silently broken for an unknown duration.

### Cross-Op Response Templating — A Closed-Input Limitation

Verify treats each example's `input` as a **closed input**: there is currently no syntax to feed a server-generated value (cart-item-id, message-id, saved-pin-id, subscription-id) from one op's response into a later op's input. This blocks any create→destroy paired write where the destroy op needs an id returned by the create op.

- **Detection signal:** the destroy op (`removeFromCart`, `unsavePin`, `deleteComment`) requires an opaque server-generated id whose only source is the create op's response body.
- **Affected sites observed:** doordash `removeFromCart`, costco `removeFromCart` + `updateCartQuantity`, target `removeFromCart`, pinterest `unsavePin`, x several pair-creates — likely 8–12 ops total across 5+ sites.
- **Current workarounds** (pick one when documenting a site):
  1. **Pre-seed a stable fixture** in the user account (e.g., trello's `openweb-verify-archiveCard-fixture` card in `cbfa285`) so the destroy op always has a known-real id to operate on.
  2. **Document the workflow** for agent-level use — agents can chain `addToCart` → read response → `removeFromCart` manually even though static verify cannot. Mark the destroy op in SKILL.md Operations notes with "Static `verify --write` cannot replay this — agents chain manually".
  3. **Wait for cross-op response templating** — proposed `${prev.<opId>.<json-path>}` syntax in example.json `input` would let verify substitute previous op responses (sequenced by `order`). One architectural change unlocks ~8–12 ops.
- **Action:** when adding a new write op whose required id is server-generated, do NOT claim "verified" if you can only run the create side. Document the gap in the site's DOC.md Known Issues + SKILL.md Known Limitations and use a pre-seeded fixture if one is feasible.

## Doc Verify

Review DOC.md against the template defined in `document.md`. The verifier
checks completeness and accuracy, not style.

### Checklist

| Check | Pass criterion |
|-------|---------------|
| **Overview** | One-liner with site archetype |
| **Workflows** | At least one multi-step workflow showing cross-operation data flow |
| **Operations table** | All operations listed with Intent, Key Input (← source), Key Output |
| **Data flow** | Every non-trivial param has a `← source` annotation |
| **Entry points** | Operations with no input dependencies marked |
| **Quick Start** | Copy-paste commands for common intents |
| **No spec duplication** | No full param lists or response schemas repeated from openapi.yaml |
| **Known Issues** | Verify failures, bot detection, rate limits documented |
| **PROGRESS.md** | File exists with at least one dated entry recording the session |

### Cross-Check with Spec

- Every operation in openapi.yaml appears in the Operations table
- No phantom operations in DOC.md that don't exist in the spec
- Workflow steps reference real operationIds

---

## Exit Criteria

All three dimensions must pass:

1. **Runtime** — Every target intent has at least one operation returning real
   data. Non-target failures documented in Known Issues.
2. **Spec** — Checklist passes. No noise, correct auth/transport/permissions.
3. **Doc** — DOC.md covers all operations, has workflows with data flow.
   PROGRESS.md exists with at least one dated entry.
   annotations, cross-checks clean against spec.

When all pass → proceed to install (guide.md Install step).
