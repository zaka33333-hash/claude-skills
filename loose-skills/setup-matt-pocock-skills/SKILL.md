description: Sets up an Agent skills block in AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md and docs/agents/ so the engineering skills know this repo's issue tracker (GitHub or local markdown), triage label vocabulary, and domain doc layout. Run before first use of to-issues, to-prd, triage, diagnose, tdd, improve-codebase-architecture, or zoom-out -- or if those skills appear to be missing context.

# Setup Matt Pocock's Skills

Scaffold the per-repo configuration that the engineering skills assume:

- **Issue tracker** -- where issues live (GitHub by default; local markdown is also supported)
- **Triage labels** -- the strings used for the five canonical triage roles
- **Domain docs** -- where CONTEXT.md and ADRs live, and the consumer rules for reading them

## Process

### 1. Explore

Look at the current repo to understand its starting state:

- `git remote -v` and `.git/config` -- is this a GitHub repo? Which one?
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root -- does either exist? Is there already an `## Agent skills` section in either?
- `CONTEXT.md` and `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the repo root
- `docs/adr/` and any `src/*/docs/adr/` directories
- `docs/agents/` -- does this skill's prior output already exist?
- `.scratch/` -- sign that a local-markdown issue tracker convention is already in use

### 2. Present findings and ask

Summarise what is present and what is missing. Then walk the user through three decisions **one at a time** -- present a section, get the user's answer, then move to the next.

**Section A -- Issue tracker.**

Options:
- **GitHub** -- issues live in the repo's GitHub Issues (uses the `gh` CLI)
- **GitLab** -- issues live in the repo's GitLab Issues (uses the `glab` CLI)
- **Local markdown** -- issues live as files under `.scratch/<feature>/` (good for solo projects)
- **Other** (Jira, Linear, etc.) -- ask the user to describe the workflow

**Section B -- Triage label vocabulary.**

The five canonical roles (defaults match their names):
- `needs-triage` -- maintainer needs to evaluate
- `needs-info` -- waiting on reporter
- `ready-for-agent` -- fully specified, AFK-ready
- `ready-for-human` -- needs human implementation
- `wontfix` -- will not be actioned

Ask the user if they want to override any. If their issue tracker has no existing labels, the defaults are fine.

**Section C -- Domain docs.**

Confirm the layout:
- **Single-context** -- one CONTEXT.md + docs/adr/ at the repo root (most repos)
- **Multi-context** -- CONTEXT-MAP.md at the root pointing to per-context CONTEXT.md files (monorepo)

### 3. Confirm and edit

Show the user a draft of:

- The `## Agent skills` block to add to CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md
- The contents of docs/agents/issue-tracker.md, docs/agents/triage-labels.md, docs/agents/domain.md

Let them edit before writing.

### 4. Write

**Pick the file to edit:**

- If CLAUDE.md exists, edit it.
- Else if AGENTS.md exists, edit it.
- If neither exists, ask the user which one to create.

Never create AGENTS.md when CLAUDE.md already exists (or vice versa).

If an `## Agent skills` block already exists, update its contents in-place rather than appending a duplicate.

The block format:

```markdown
## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

[one-line summary]. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

[one-line summary]. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

[single-context or multi-context]. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
```

Then write the three docs files in docs/agents/.

### 5. Done

Tell the user the setup is complete and which engineering skills will now read from these files. Mention they can edit `docs/agents/*.md` directly later.
