# Source-Driven Development

## Overview

Every framework-specific code decision must be backed by official documentation. Don't implement from memory — verify, cite, and let the user see your sources. Training data goes stale, APIs get deprecated, best practices evolve. This skill ensures the user gets code they can trust because every pattern traces back to an authoritative source they can check.

## When to Use

- The user wants code that follows current best practices for a given framework
- Building boilerplate, starter code, or patterns that will be copied across a project
- The user explicitly asks for documented, verified, or "correct" implementation
- Implementing features where the framework's recommended approach matters (forms, routing, data fetching, state management, auth)
- Any time you are about to write framework-specific code from memory

**When NOT to use:**
- Correctness does not depend on a specific version (renaming variables, fixing typos, moving files)
- Pure logic that works the same across all versions (loops, conditionals, data structures)
- The user explicitly wants speed over verification ("just do it quickly")

## The Process

```
DETECT -> FETCH -> IMPLEMENT -> CITE
```

### Step 1: Detect Stack and Versions

Read the project's dependency file to identify exact versions:

```
package.json         -> Node/React/Vue/Angular/Svelte
composer.json        -> PHP/Symfony/Laravel
requirements.txt     -> Python/Django/Flask
go.mod               -> Go
Cargo.toml           -> Rust
Gemfile              -> Ruby/Rails
```

State what you found explicitly:

```
STACK DETECTED:
- React 19.1.0 (from package.json)
- Vite 6.2.0
- Tailwind CSS 4.0.3
-> Fetching official docs for the relevant patterns.
```

If versions are missing or ambiguous, ask the user. Don't guess.

### Step 2: Fetch Official Documentation

Fetch the specific documentation page for the feature you're implementing.

**Source hierarchy (in order of authority):**

| Priority | Source | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Official documentation | react.dev, docs.djangoproject.com |
| 2 | Official blog / changelog | react.dev/blog, nextjs.org/blog |
| 3 | Web standards references | MDN, web.dev |
| 4 | Browser/runtime compatibility | caniuse.com, node.green |

**Not authoritative — never cite as primary sources:**
- Stack Overflow answers
- Blog posts or tutorials (even popular ones)
- AI-generated documentation or summaries
- Your own training data

**Be precise with what you fetch:**

```
BAD:  Fetch the React homepage
GOOD: Fetch react.dev/reference/react/useActionState

BAD:  Search "django authentication best practices"
GOOD: Fetch docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/auth/
```

### Step 3: Implement Following Documented Patterns

Write code that matches what the documentation shows:
- Use the API signatures from the docs, not from memory
- If the docs show a new way to do something, use the new way
- If the docs deprecate a pattern, don't use the deprecated version
- If the docs don't cover something, flag it as unverified

**When docs conflict with existing project code:**

```
CONFLICT DETECTED:
The existing codebase uses useState for form loading state,
but React 19 docs recommend useActionState for this pattern.
(Source: react.dev/reference/react/useActionState)

Options:
A) Use the modern pattern (useActionState) -- consistent with current docs
B) Match existing code (useState) -- consistent with codebase
-> Which approach do you prefer?
```

Surface the conflict. Don't silently pick one.

### Step 4: Cite Your Sources

Every framework-specific pattern gets a citation.

**In code comments:**

```typescript
// React 19 form handling with useActionState
// Source: https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState#usage
const [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(submitOrder, initialState);
```

**Citation rules:**
- Full URLs, not shortened
- Prefer deep links with anchors where possible
- Quote the relevant passage when it supports a non-obvious decision
- If you cannot find documentation for a pattern, say so explicitly:

```
UNVERIFIED: I could not find official documentation for this
pattern. This is based on training data and may be outdated.
Verify before using in production.
```

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'm confident about this API" | Confidence is not evidence. Training data contains outdated patterns. Verify. |
| "Fetching docs wastes tokens" | Hallucinating an API wastes more. One fetch prevents hours of rework. |
| "The docs won't have what I need" | If the docs don't cover it, that is valuable information. |
| "I'll just mention it might be outdated" | Either verify and cite, or clearly flag it as unverified. Hedging is the worst option. |

## Red Flags

- Writing framework-specific code without checking the docs for that version
- Using "I believe" or "I think" about an API instead of citing the source
- Citing Stack Overflow or blog posts instead of official documentation
- Using deprecated APIs because they appear in training data
- Not reading dependency files before implementing

## Verification

After implementing with source-driven development:

- [ ] Framework and library versions were identified from the dependency file
- [ ] Official documentation was fetched for framework-specific patterns
- [ ] All sources are official documentation, not blog posts or training data
- [ ] Code follows the patterns shown in the current version's documentation
- [ ] Non-trivial decisions include source citations with full URLs
- [ ] No deprecated APIs are used (checked against migration guides)
- [ ] Conflicts between docs and existing code were surfaced to the user
- [ ] Anything that could not be verified is explicitly flagged as unverified
