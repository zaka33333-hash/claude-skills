description: Prepares production launches. Use when preparing to deploy to production. Use when you need a pre-launch checklist, when setting up monitoring, when planning a staged rollout, or when you need a rollback strategy. Covers feature flags, canary rollouts, and post-launch verification.

# Shipping and Launch

## Overview

Ship with confidence. The goal is not just to deploy -- it is to deploy safely, with monitoring in place, a rollback plan ready, and a clear understanding of what success looks like. Every launch should be reversible, observable, and incremental.

## When to Use

- Deploying a feature to production for the first time
- Releasing a significant change to users
- Migrating data or infrastructure
- Opening a beta or early access program
- Any deployment that carries risk (all of them)

## The Pre-Launch Checklist

### Code Quality

- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Build succeeds with no warnings
- [ ] Lint and type checking pass
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] No TODO comments that should be resolved before launch
- [ ] No console.log debugging statements in production code
- [ ] Error handling covers expected failure modes

### Security

- [ ] No secrets in code or version control
- [ ] npm audit shows no critical or high vulnerabilities
- [ ] Input validation on all user-facing endpoints
- [ ] Authentication and authorization checks in place
- [ ] Security headers configured (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- [ ] CORS configured to specific origins (not wildcard)

### Performance

- [ ] Core Web Vitals within "Good" thresholds (LCP <=2.5s, INP <=200ms, CLS <=0.1)
- [ ] No N+1 queries in critical paths
- [ ] Images optimized (compression, responsive sizes, lazy loading)
- [ ] Bundle size within budget
- [ ] Database queries have appropriate indexes
- [ ] Caching configured for static assets and repeated queries

### Accessibility

- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- [ ] Screen reader can convey page content and structure
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA (4.5:1 for text)
- [ ] Focus management correct for modals and dynamic content
- [ ] No accessibility warnings in axe-core or Lighthouse

### Infrastructure

- [ ] Environment variables set in production
- [ ] Database migrations applied (or ready to apply)
- [ ] DNS and SSL configured
- [ ] CDN configured for static assets
- [ ] Logging and error reporting configured
- [ ] Health check endpoint exists and responds

## Feature Flag Strategy

Ship behind feature flags to decouple deployment from release:

```
Feature flag lifecycle:
1. DEPLOY with flag OFF     -> Code is in production but inactive
2. ENABLE for team/beta     -> Internal testing in production environment
3. GRADUAL ROLLOUT          -> 5% -> 25% -> 50% -> 100% of users
4. MONITOR at each stage    -> Watch error rates, performance, user feedback
5. CLEAN UP                 -> Remove flag and dead code path after full rollout
```

**Rules:**
- Every feature flag has an owner and an expiration date
- Clean up flags within 2 weeks of full rollout
- Don't nest feature flags (creates exponential combinations)
- Test both flag states (on and off) in CI

## Staged Rollout

```
1. DEPLOY to staging
   -> Full test suite in staging
   -> Manual smoke test of critical flows

2. DEPLOY to production (feature flag OFF)
   -> Verify deployment succeeded (health check)
   -> Check error monitoring (no new errors)

3. ENABLE for team (flag ON for internal users)
   -> 24-hour monitoring window

4. CANARY rollout (flag ON for 5% of users)
   -> Monitor error rates, latency, user behavior
   -> 24-48 hour monitoring window

5. GRADUAL increase (25% -> 50% -> 100%)
   -> Same monitoring at each step

6. FULL rollout
   -> Monitor for 1 week
   -> Clean up feature flag
```

### Rollout Decision Thresholds

| Metric | Advance (green) | Hold (yellow) | Roll back (red) |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Error rate | Within 10% of baseline | 10-100% above baseline | >2x baseline |
| P95 latency | Within 20% of baseline | 20-50% above baseline | >50% above baseline |
| Client JS errors | No new error types | New errors <0.1% sessions | New errors >0.1% sessions |
| Business metrics | Neutral or positive | Decline <5% | Decline >5% |

## Monitoring and Observability

What to monitor:

```
Application: error rate, response time (p50/p95/p99), request volume, active users
Infrastructure: CPU/memory, DB connections, disk space, network latency
Client: Core Web Vitals, JavaScript errors, API error rates, page load time
```

### Post-Launch Verification

In the first hour after launch:
1. Check health endpoint returns 200
2. Check error monitoring dashboard (no new error types)
3. Check latency dashboard (no regression)
4. Test the critical user flow manually
5. Verify logs are flowing and readable
6. Confirm rollback mechanism works

## Rollback Strategy

Every deployment needs a rollback plan before it happens:

```
Trigger Conditions:
- Error rate > 2x baseline
- P95 latency > Xms
- User reports of specific issue

Rollback Steps:
1. Disable feature flag (if applicable)
   OR deploy previous version: git revert <commit> && git push
2. Verify rollback: health check, error monitoring
3. Communicate: notify team of rollback

Time to Rollback:
- Feature flag: < 1 minute
- Redeploy previous version: < 5 minutes
- Database rollback: < 15 minutes
```

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "It works in staging, it'll work in production" | Production has different data, traffic patterns, and edge cases. Monitor after deploy. |
| "We don't need feature flags for this" | Every feature benefits from a kill switch. |
| "Monitoring is overhead" | You discover problems from user complaints instead of dashboards. |
| "Rolling back is admitting failure" | Rolling back is responsible engineering. Shipping a broken feature is the failure. |

## Red Flags

- Deploying without a rollback plan
- No monitoring or error reporting in production
- Big-bang releases (everything at once, no staging)
- Feature flags with no expiration or owner
- No one monitoring the deploy for the first hour
- "It's Friday afternoon, let's ship it"

## Verification

Before deploying:

- [ ] Pre-launch checklist completed (all sections green)
- [ ] Feature flag configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards set up
- [ ] Team notified of deployment

After deploying:

- [ ] Health check returns 200
- [ ] Error rate is normal
- [ ] Latency is normal
- [ ] Critical user flow works
- [ ] Logs are flowing
- [ ] Rollback tested or verified ready
